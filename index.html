        A lot of data exchange takes place on the back of Web technology: JSON over HTTP, HTML
        forms, database backends, and more. However, at each stage in the data production and usage
        flow there are impedance mismatches. Data validation is done differently on the client side,
        the server side, and in the database. Forms are hand-crafted to match a loose data model,
        often poorly. APIs to Web systems are documented using yet another system.

        Since it is essentially the same data that is being used at each stage, it could benefit 
        from a common definition. The goal of Web Schema is to provide a useful intersection between
        the data model that HTML forms can capture, JSON, and common constraints used in databases
        that serve Web systems. It further aims to do so in a way that is simple to implement and
        using a language that is simple to author, including by hand. While validation is one of the
        goals of Web Schema, it is not the only one. For instance, generating HTML forms and as much
        of the paraphernalia of data processing in a Web context as possible are explicit 
        priorities.
