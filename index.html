        A lot of data exchange takes place on the back of Web technology: JSON over HTTP, HTML
        forms, database backends, and more. However, at each stage in the data production and usage
        flow there are impedance mismatches. Data validation is done differently on the client side,
        the server side, and in the database. Forms are hand-crafted to match a loose data model,
        often poorly. APIs to Web systems are documented using yet another system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it is essentially the same data that is being used at each stage, it could benefit 
        from a common definition. The goal of Web Schema is to provide a useful intersection between
        the data model that HTML forms can capture, JSON, and common constraints used in databases
        that serve Web systems. It further aims to do so in a way that is simple to implement and
        using a language that is simple to author, including by hand. While validation is one of the
        goals of Web Schema, it is not the only one. For instance, generating HTML forms and as much
        of the paraphernalia of data processing in a Web context as possible are explicit 
        priorities.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Data on the Web is hard. And we reinvent it all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a form that's talking to an HTTP API using JSON, chances are that your 
        bi-directional binding that allows you to create and edit fields in the API inside a browser
        and to load content from the API into the form is entirely ad-hoc. Tools like AngularJS
        can make the process simpler, notably at the UI level, but you still have to hand-craft a
        form that corresponds to the data model, and wire that into AngularJS (or any other similar
        library).
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the validation that is performed on the client will be different (and largely
        if not entirely rewritten) from that which takes place on the server; and it's not unlikely
        that your database will in turn have its own validation layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do have tools that help here and there, with parts of the problem, usually for a single
        platform. But we keep reinventing those parts and finding limitations in them that need
        painful workarounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of Web Schema is to provide a foundation that enables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>client-side validation, of JavaScript objects or of forms;</li>
        <li>server-side validation;</li>
        <li>database schema generation;</li>
        <li>
          HTML form generation, in a customisable fashion that does not pigeon-hole developers;
        </li>
        <li>conversion to and from other formats, as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To be entirely clear: Web Schema does <em>not</em> intend to provide all of the above 
        built-in. Rather, it defines a common, simple language that enables a shared data model so
        that the above services can be built on top of it with minimal effort. The idea is that a
        shared way of describing data and a common data model enables many use cases to be addressed
        and plugged together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parts that this specification covers explicitly are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a core language to describe data;</li>
        <li>validation of JSON objects;</li>
        <li>and validation of HTML form data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In developing this technology, inspiration was taken largely from two sources. First,
        JSON Schema, which provides a great starting place. The primary reason it is not used 
        directly is to maintain the ability to break it freely (and break it we do). Second, HTML
        forms. Few people have noticed that forms actually define a schema language of their own,
        and an explicit goal of Web Schema is to interoperate strongly with forms so as to provide
        a simple bidirectional mapping between HTML forms and a flexible data model.
